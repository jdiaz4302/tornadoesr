## Summary

This repository roughly serves as the documentation to my internship project's workflow. Code files and notebooks are spread amongst 3 main folders: "Complete Workflow", "Python", and "R". "Python" and "R" contain code related to their respective programming languages. "Python" primarily consists of the code to produce and evaluate models, while "R" primarily consists of the code for data retrieval, integration, and processing. "Complete Workflow" serves as an ordered, complete workflow to allow maximum reproducibility.

This project aims to predict tornado-induced property damage based on variables that you can know before a tornado event, variables that describe the tornado event, and both of those sets of variables combined. The predictive models consist of multivariate regressions and artificial neural networks made in PyTorch, a deep learning framework.
