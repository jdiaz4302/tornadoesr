## Summary

This repository roughly serves as the documentation to my internship project's workflow. R scripts, R Markdown files, and Jupyter notebooks are spread among 2 main folders: "Complete Workflow" and "Old Code". Within "Old Code", "Python" and "R" contain code related to their respective programming languages. Both of these files contain scripts and notebooks that may no longer be relevent to the project. "Python" primarily consists of the code to produce and evaluate models, while "R" primarily consists of the code for data retrieval, integration, and processing. "Complete Workflow" serves as an ordered, complete workflow to allow maximum reproducibility and clarity.

This project aims to predict dollar-amount, tornado-induced property damage based on variables that you can know before a tornado event, variables that describe the tornado event, and both of those sets of variables combined. The predictive models consist of various multivariate regressions and artificial neural networks made in PyTorch, a deep learning framework.
