      " This was the fourth tornado to develop in northwest Houston county, spawned by the same thunderstorm.  The tornado began just south of Westgate Parkway, and then quickly intensified, snapping 5 power poles near Westgate Parkway and Technology Drive.  Several houses in nearby neighborhoods had some roof damage and a barn also had roof damage.  The remainder of the track was mostly tree damage with the tornado ending just south of the Henry-Houston county border, still in Houston county.  This tornado was rated EF1 with max winds estimated near 100 mph.  Damage cost was estimated. \n",

      " The tornado began southeast of Columbus on Frisco Road. Here, there were a few trees snapped and limb debris. The tornado continued northeast crossing Hughes Road and Hildreth Road, snapping and downing trees along the path. As it crossed Hughes Road, it peeled back the roof of a shed. The tornado began to get wider as it moved across Hildreth Road. The tornado continued through a wooded area north of Hildreth Road until crossing Bryant Road. Here a fence was blown down and higher damage occurred at the dead end. Many trees were blown down along the end of the road and shingle damaged occurred to a few homes. Large trees were downed off to the north of the road in the wooded area. It began to show signs of becoming a multiple vortex tornado, as there seemed to be two distinct corridors of damage. The tornado continued northeast before crossing Highway 69 where many trees were snapped, bringing down a powerline and snapping a powerpole. The tornado continued northeast before crossing New Hope Road and Petersburg Road. Along in this area the tornado was very wide, over a quarter mile, and caused numerous trees to be downed. A few trees were on homes, especially along Petersburg Road, where numerous homes had shingle damage, a tree fell on a home and minor damage occurred to a shed. The tornado continued northeast before crossing Pritchard Lane, continuing to show signs of a multi-vortex tornado. Numerous trees were downed along the road and minor roof damage occurred to a shed. The tornado then crossed Lake Lowndes Road where many trees were snapped and a few powerlines were blown down. It was in this area and crossing into the Lakeover subdivision on Lakeover Drive where the highest damage occurred with high end EF1 damage with winds reaching around 110 mph. Numerous trees were blown down, with some falling into homes, and numerous had shingle damage. The tornado continued northeast, crossing Lake Lowndes Road and Ernest Drive. Many large trees were blown down and roof was peeled back on a shed on Ernest Drive. The tornado crossed Old Yorkville Road, continuing to take down numerous trees along the path and taking down a powerpole. The tornado then crossed into an open field before moving into a wooded area. The tornado continued before crossing State Line Road at the Mississippi-Alabama border, where a powerpole was snapped and numerous trees were uprooted. The tornado began to turn more to the north-northeast after crossing the state line into Alabama and crossed Robin Road, where multiple trees were downed, blocking the railroad tracks. It continued north-northeast and crossed Eagle Road, where numerous trees were uprooted and snapped. The tornado continued across County Road 30 and Pine Wood Circle, snapping and uprooting many trees. The tornado dissipated just after crossing Highway 82. It was rated an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds of 110 mph. The damage path length was 5.8 miles (7.9 miles total). The maximum path width was 600 yards. \n",

      " The National Weather Service in State College confirmed an EF1 tornado occurred near Scandia in Warren County Pennsylvania on September 17, 2016. Most of the damage was in the EF0 category, with lots of trees down and snapped off above the ground.  A few larger trees were uprooted.  Half of a very large metal equipment garage which was bolted to the concrete was torn away and moved 150 to 200 yards to the north into a tree line. This damage is more-consistent with an EF1 tornado with peak wind speeds around 110 MPH. ||The tornado touched down at approximately 635 PM EDT around one-half mile southeast of the intersection of Scandia and Peterson Roads in northeastern Warren County. The tornado progressed to the east, crossing Peterson Rd, making damage to trees before moving across a farm field. The tornado picked up half of a large pole barn/garage and moved the debris 200 yards to the north into a stand of trees. Substantial tree damage was observed along a line of trees bordering the farm field to the east of the pole barn.  Additional sporadic tree damage was observed for another mile or so. The end-point of the damage was determined using GPS locations and photographs of damage from residents along trails leading through the woods to the North Branch of Hodge Run. \n",

      " This is the second segment of a two segment tornado that began at 624 pm CDT in Bryan County, Oklahoma. The tornado strengthened and widened rapidly after developing southeast of Bennington.  It was about 2500 yards wide and was producing EF-2 damage to trees by the time it reached the Choctaw County border at around 627 pm CDT. ||In Choctaw County, the tornado continued to widen as it moved northeast, producing a damage path of about 1.8 miles across, to the southwest of Boswell. The tornado made a turn to the east at the N4000 Road and maintained an eastward movement until dissipating before reaching the N4090 Road. The tornado destroyed at least three mobile homes. Two injuries occurred in one of the mobile homes, one of which was a critical injury. Numerous homes were damaged by this tornado, with the worst damage including major loss of the roof structure and collapse of a few exterior walls. Numerous outbuildings were also destroyed. A metal, high-voltage transmission tower/truss was destroyed, and numerous power poles were snapped. Many trees were snapped or uprooted in the path. Trees in several areas were reduced to shortened trunks with short stumps where large limbs previously existed. Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in this segment of the tornado was 140 to 150 mph. \n",

      " A tornado formed in far northern Marion County, about one half mile from the Sequatchie County border and quickly intensified to a strong EF-2 tornado with winds of 130 mph as it crossed into Sequatchie County. A double wide mobile home was completely destroyed and an adjacent church roof was heavily damaged. The tornado passed through a grove of trees snapping nearly all of them halfway up the trunk. The strong tornado passed through a farm and caused significant damage to a two story family home. This part of the tornado path was determined to be at the high end of the EF-2 rating. As the tornado continued along a northeasterly track, two additional homes were heavily damaged before moving along an unpopulated ridge. The tornado likely skipped along this ridge as it crossed Highway 127 and then crossed Highway 111. A mobile home roof was completely removed near the corner of Shell Road and Tri Mile Road along with numerous trees that were either uprooted or snapped. The damage track seemed to end near Snow Bird Lane and Raven Cliff Road. Rear flank downdraft damage was noted farther east along Lewis Chapel Road to about Laurelwood Trail. Major roof damage was seen along Natures Trail and Lewis Chapel Road where winds were estimated around 100 mph. \n",

      " An EF0 tornado touched downed in a field in rural Wayne Township near the southern border of Ashtabula County.  The initial touchdown occurred along Hayes Road about half way between U.S. Route 322 and the county line.  A few trees were downed in the area. The tornado continued east northeast across mainly farm land while quickly intensifying to EF1 intensity.  The tornado eventually reached the Williamsfield area and crossed State Route 7 just south of its intersection with U.S. Route 322.  It then intensified to EF2 strength and roughly followed U.S. 322 for close to two miles.  The tornado then took a turn to the northeast as it crossed Simons South Road and lifted just as it reached the Pennsylvania state line.  The worst damage was observed along U.S. 322 east of State Route 7.  Around 20 properties were affected by the tornado.  At least four homes were destroyed with eight more sustaining major damage.  The other homes along the damage path sustained lesser amounts of damage.  The four destroyed homes were all within a third of mile from each other on U.S. 322.  A couple garages along U.S. 322 were also leveled and tree damage was extensive.   Debris was observed scattered in fields across the area.  The damage path was over six and a half miles in length and up to 200 yards in width.  It took several days for power to be restored in the Williamsfield area.  No injuries were reported. \n",

The tornado then moved ENE and touched back down on the east side of the Palmetto Expressway in a warehouse district from NW 50th Street to NW 52nd Street between NW 74th and 69th avenues. In this area, EF-0 to borderline EF-1 damage (75-85 mph winds) was noted. A tractor trailer was overturned, at least 2 dozen empty cargo containers were moved, and minor roof damage occurred to an office building. ||The tornado then moved NE and crossed into Miami Springs. Primarily impacted was the Bird District between Shadow and Ludlum Avenues and Falcon and Dove Avenues. The worst damage was on the 1100 block of Falcon, Plover and Wren consisting of loss of roof covering material and downed trees. Winds were likely in the EF-1 range (90-95 mph) in this area. Damage was observed along a NE path along the remainder of the Miami Springs portion of the path, with most of the damage east of Hammond Drive to Okeechobee Road consisting of downed power lines and trees (EF-0). ||After crossing Okeechobee Road, the tornado entered the City of Hialeah and caused damage to the area from Red Road to W 2nd Avenue between West 10th and 13th streets. Four two-story apartment buildings sustained roof damage of EF-1 intensity (up to 95 mph). The tornado passed very close to a water plant, but no damage was noted there. The tornado lifted near W 2nd Avenue and W 13th Street. A total of 13 families were left homeless in Hialeah and required Red Cross assistance.||No damage estimated were received. \n",

      " EF1 tornado confirmed. A tornado touched down on the border of Gilmore and Wayne Townships along Holy Hill Rd. Tree damage was observed with several softwood trees snapped at the trunk. The tornado moved east-southeast and took nearly the entire roof off of a house. It also tore the entire deck off, which was attached with metal straps. A piece of the deck became a projectile and was driven into the windshield of a car. The winds moved a 35 pound battery about 20 yards. The tornado continued down a valley and eventually lifted near Oak Forest Rd. In the valley, numerous hardwood trees were snapped at the trunk, and some of them were uprooted. \n",

The tin roof was peeled away from its wooden supports, some of which were broken. Large trees were snapped and uprooted and were laying in multiple directions. A well constructed sturdy barn with metal supports was completely mangled and collapsed. Debris from the barn and the house was tossed into the woods behind it|and wrapped around trees. The tornado then tracked east, with a swath of damage bordering and along CR-140. The houses all along this road had shingle damage, as well as a few holes through the wood of the roof. Another house had an east facing door blown in with a back porch pulled away from another. One house in particular, along with roof damage, had a roof completely removed from a large car port with its supports pulled from the concrete. A trailer was also picked up and placed on top of a tractor. This house also had a row of trees completely snapped near the center of the tree. All along the road there were very large trees uprooted and trunks snapped. The tornado moved east through forested areas before impacting more houses along CR-449. One house had a window blown out and an interior door was twisted along with a small outbuilding collapsed. Next door, a mobile home had the tin peeled off and twisted and some thrown around trees. Siding on the back side was peeled off and the undercarriage was blown out in a few places. A standalone garage port was slightly|shifted off its foundation with the doors blown in. Multiple trees were uprooted and snapped as well. The tornado crossed AL-101 uprooting trees. A mobile home had a few shingles missing along with a few trees uprooted and snapped were found near CR-256 and Broad Hollow Road. No damage was found east of this point. \n",

This could have been the continuation of a tornado path that began across the southwest part of the county and straddled the Caldwell County line. However, the path of that tornado was lost in a heavily wooded area east of Caldwell Pond Rd and south of Highway 64. This tornado path began along Highway 64 in the Ellendale community and moved northeast, uprooting or snapping numerous trees along a fairly continuous path. The path was lost along Seth Deal Rd, about a mile west of Highway 16 and a mile south of the Wilkes County border.

      " The tornado started northwest of the intersection of Beam Church Rd|and Wigstrom Rd where several trees fell and a house sustained minor|siding damage. The tornado crossed Beam Church Rd and continued east|southeast into Gray. Several buildings sustained roof or siding|damage from downed trees. Many trees were completely uprooted|because of saturated soil with standing water underneath the root|ball. The tornado crossed W 3rd street where it flipped a car port|and moved a trailer about 6 feet. A large patch of shingles was|tossed over a house and landed on a car windshield.||Further east, several healthy trees were snapped 10-30 feet off the|ground consistent with winds of up to 90 mph. Healthy pines fell in|a convergent pattern perpendicular to storm motion. This pattern is|consistent with a tornado. The tornado appears to have lifted right|before a stream in the block bordered by W 3rd Street, E 1st Street,|Main St and Center St. \n",

      " The tornado was on the ground for 7 miles (approximately 24 minutes) from south of Capitol, Montana northeast into South Dakota. In Montana, the tornado path was 3 miles long with a width of 200 yards. Damage ranged from EF-1 at the initial touchdown, increasing to EF-2 just before the South Dakota border. Large tree limbs were downed and trees snapped. The damage became more widespread as the path approached the Little Missouri River. |The maximum wind speed during the life of the tornado was 136 mph (EF-3). The tornado ranged from 200 yards wide in Montana to a half mile wide in South Dakota. \n",

The only structural damage to note was a couple small farm structures and sheds that were heavily damaged or destroyed adjacent to Evergreen Rd, consistent with EF-1 damage. Damage indicators became more widely scattered as it approached I-65, but several trees were observed damaged along Wilhite Rd. \n",

The tornado entered Wayne County in Rockwood and then continued for another 2 miles, before dissipating near the intersection of Meadow Lane and Ostreich Road near the border of Brownstown Charter Township and the city of Gibraltar. The tornado remained at EF0 strength throughout the entire path length. Damage included multiple limbs and large trees downed, along with missing shingles to a house near the end of the tornado path. \n",

Evidence of cyclonic rotation was noted in this concentrated area of damage where several 1 to 2 foot diameter trees were either uprooted or snapped. On the south side of the path, trees were laying in an ENE direction, with the trees on the left/north side of the path laying NNW. The tornado touchdown was very brief and lifted at the intersection of Cedar Sink Road and Brownsville Road just inside the SW border of Mammoth Cave National Park. Peak winds were estimated at 80 mph, with a max path width of 65 yards. The path length was about a third of a mile and the tornado was on the ground for less than 1 minute. \n",
